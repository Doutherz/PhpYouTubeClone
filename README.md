This project was my first time learning and using Php
Was ran using XAMPP

YouTube Clone functionality:

- It is connected to a MySQL database
- Allows user to upload videos that get saved to a folder on the server
- Users can make video public and private (only the logged in user can see their own private videos)
- Users can watch videos uploaded in the web browser
